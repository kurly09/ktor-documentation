# Client Retry

A sample Ktor project showing how to use the [HttpRequestRetry](https://ktor.io/docs/client-retry.html) plugin.

## Running

Before running this sample, start a server from the [simulate-slow-server](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor-documentation/tree/%branch-name%/codeSnippets/snippets/simulate-slow-server) example:
```bash
./gradlew :simulate-slow-server:run
```

This sample has the `/error` route that returns the `200 OK` response from a third attempt only.

To see `HttpRequestRetry` in action, run this example by executing the following command:

```bash
./gradlew :client-retry:run
```

The client will send three consequent requests automatically to get a success response from the server.

> Note that this example uses the [Logging](https://ktor.io/docs/client-logging.html) plugin to show all requests in a console.
