Ktor supports [Kotlin/Native](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/native-overview.html) and allows you to run a server without an additional runtime or virtual machine.

## Limitations {id="limitations"}

Currently, running a Ktor server under Kotlin/Native has the following limitations:
* Only the [CIO engine](Engines.md) is supported.
* [WebSockets](websocket.md) are not supported.
* [HTTPS](ssl.md) is not supported.
* Windows is not supported.


## Add dependencies {id="add-dependencies"}

To use Ktor server in a Kotlin/Native project, you need to add at least two dependencies: a `ktor-server-core` dependency and an engine dependency (CIO). The code snippet below shows how to add dependencies to the `nativeMain` source set in the `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
```
{src="snippets/embedded-server-native/build.gradle.kts" lines="36-42,48"}

## Declare native binaries {id="binaries"}

To [declare a native binary](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/mpp-build-native-binaries.html), use the `binaries` property of a native target:

```kotlin
```
{src="snippets/embedded-server-native/build.gradle.kts" lines="20-35"}

You can find the full example here: [embedded-server-native](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor-documentation/tree/%branch-name%/codeSnippets/snippets/embedded-server-native).

## Create a server {id="create-server"}

After configuring your Gradle build script, you can create a Ktor server as described here: [](create_server.xml).
